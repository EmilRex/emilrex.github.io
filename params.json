I was actually going to make a blog with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), but that seemed like overkill. In any case, here it is and here you are so let me tell you a bit about myself.\r\n\r\nI am from Denmark originally, but I have spent most of my life abroad. I have lived in the US for the past eight years and recently moved to New York City to study at New York University. I enjoy writing beautiful code and learning everything I can about technology. I also have the privilege of working as a Data Engineer at [enigma.io](http://enigma.io/) where I get to play with data and python all day. \r\n\r\nI hope that you find some of projects interesting and perhaps even useful.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
