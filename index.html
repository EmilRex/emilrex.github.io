<hr>

<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>My name is Emil and this site is where I try to document any noteworthy projects I've worked on. I was actually going to make a blog with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>, but that seemed like overkill. In any case, here it is and here you are so let me tell you a bit about myself.</p>

<p>I am originally from Denmark, but I have spent most of my life abroad. I have lived in the US for the past eight years and recently moved to New York City to study at New York University. I enjoy writing beautiful code and learning everything I can about technology. I also have the privilege of working as a Data Engineer at <a href="http://enigma.io/">enigma.io</a> where I get to play with data and python all day.</p>


<h1>Projects</h1>


<h3>Searching for Water on Exo-Planets (2014)</h3>

<p></p>The summer after I finished my undergraduate studies I had the good fortune of working with <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/~cchen/STScI/index.html">Christine Chen</a> at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore.</p)

<p>At STScI I worked on a model of infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with silicate and water-ice features. The ultimate purpose of the model was to examine where and when ice appears in star systems. The <a href="http://github.com/EmilRex/Silicate_Feature_Analysis">code</a> is available on GitHub and you can see my final presentation <a href="http://webcast.stsci.edu/webcast/detail.xhtml;jsessionid=2BD2A1ABC524B0386D183B0E4AFE5E0C?talkid=4312&parent=1">here</a> (<a href="docs/SASP_2014_slides.pdf">slides</a>).</p>

<h3>Hunting for Galaxies Far, Far Away (2012-2014)</h3>

<p>At James Madison University, where I studied Physics, I worked with <a href="http://csma31.csm.jmu.edu/physics/constaax/index.html">Anca Constantin</a> on an extensive classification study of masers. A maser is a galaxy which exhibits a specific type of strong radio emission. Masers are important in astrophysics because they establish highly accurate and independent distance measurements to far away objects. However, there are not many known masers and discovering them is an expensive and laborious process. So this project aimed to increase the probability of discovery by correlating other characteristics of maser hosting galaxies with the occurence of masers. This project also where I learned the fundementals of coding as well as a bit of machine learning in the form of PCA. I even managed to pick up a bit of Python.</p>

<p>I presented my research at the <a href="docs/CAA_2013_poster.pdf">11th CAA Undergraduate Research Conference</a> at Old Dominion University in April 2013 and at the <a href="docs/AAS_2014_poster.pdf">223rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society</a> in Washington, DC in January 2014 (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AAS...22315027C">abstract</a>). I also presented my research at the <a href="docs/JMU_symposium_2014.pdf">2014 JMU Physics and Astronomy Symposium</a> where my presentation won <a href="http://jmuphysics.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-2014-jmu-physics-and-astronomy.html">1st place</a>. Dr. Constantin and I were even lucky enough to be featured in JMU's <a href="http://www.jmu.edu/stories/2013/2013-anca-constantin-research.shtml">Madison Magazine</a>.</p>
