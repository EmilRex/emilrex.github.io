<hr>

<p>Hi there!</p>

<p>My name is Emil and this site is where I try to document any noteworthy projects I've worked on. I was actually going to make a blog with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>, but that seemed like overkill. In any case, here it is and here you are so let me tell you a bit about myself.</p>

<p>I am from Denmark originally, but I have spent most of my life abroad. I have lived in the US for the past eight years and recently moved to New York City to study at New York University. I enjoy writing beautiful code and learning everything I can about technology. I also have the privilege of working as a Data Engineer at <a href="http://enigma.io/">enigma.io</a> where I get to play with data and python all day. </p>

<p>I hope that you find some of projects interesting and perhaps even useful.</p>
